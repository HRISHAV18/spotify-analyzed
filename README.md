# Spotify-Analyzed

Utilizing ML algorithms coupled with data visualization on Spotify Dataset (kNN, Regression, FCN). <br>

# Motivation

The goal of this project is to better analyse the Spotify data to employ practical analytical techniques on two critical levels for producers and consumers. While the prediction model serves as an indicator of the popularity of the song produced by the artist, the consumers can benefit from the music recommendation engine which recommends similar songs to the user. <br>

# Dataset

The Dataset was picked up from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks <br><br>
This dataset includes the following files in the directory /data: <br><br>
a) data.csv : Main data file containing data about 160k+ genres <br>
b) data_by_artists.csv : Aforementioned data.csv grouped by artists <br>
c) data_by_genre.csv : Aforementioned data.csv grouped by genre <br>
d) data_by_year.csv : Aforementioned data.csv grouped by year <br>
e) data_w_genres.csv : Aforementioned data.csv with genre implementation for each artist <br>

# Other included files
f) Spotify_Analyzed_Presentation.pdf : A powerpoint presentation summarizing our efforts. <br>
g) Spotify_Analyzed_Project_Report.pdf : A detailed description of our proceedings and analysis of the dataset. <br>
h) code/Spotify_Data_Analysis.ipynb : Python notebook containing code. <br>
i) code/genre_classification_NN_approach.ipynb : Experimentation on genre classification using Neural Network <br>
j) requirements.txt : A list of python packages that are required to run our project. <br>
